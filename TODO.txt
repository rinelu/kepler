Kepler – TODO
====================

Next (High Priority)
-------------------

Physics
- Fix Barnes–Hut Newton’s 3rd law violation
- Improve energy behavior at high time scales
- Finalize adaptive sub-stepping heuristics
- Remove remaining integrator edge cases

World Scale
- Add floating-origin support
- Stabilize precision at large distances

Interaction
- Mouse picking for body selection
- Stable camera follow at high velocities
- Smooth camera mode transitions

Rendering
- Orbit path visualization (toggleable)
- Starfield / sky background
- Debug vectors (velocity, acceleration)

Known Gaps
- No collisions or merging
- No save/load
- No deterministic replay

Mid-Term
--------

Simulation
- Stable orbits without manual tuning
- Robust behavior at extreme mass ratios

Collisions (Optional)
- Sphere–sphere collision detection
- Momentum-preserving merges

Performance
- Pool octree nodes
- Reduce per-step allocations
- Stress-test with 1k+ bodies

Tooling
- Minimal on-screen debug overlay
- Pause + inspect mode

Long-Term
---------

Physics
- Tidal forces
- Relativistic correction toggle (visual)

Data
- Save/load world state
- Snapshot export
- Scriptable system generation

Non-Goals
---------
- Full astrophysics accuracy
- Gas or fluid simulation
