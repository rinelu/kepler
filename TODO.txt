PARTIALLY DONE
--------------

Physics
- Barnes–Hut gravity
  (works, but violates Newton’s 3rd law)
- Energy stability at high time scales
  (improved, not guaranteed)
- Adaptive sub-stepping heuristics
  (still edge cases at extreme acceleration)

World Scale
- Precision handling at large distances
  (improved indirectly, no floating origin)

Rendering
- Atmospheres
  (rim lighting exists, full atmospheres incomplete)
- Orbit path visualization
  (experimentation started, not integrated)

Camera
- Camera follow at high velocities
  (exists, damping and prediction incomplete)
- FREE camera inertia / velocity model
  (basic movement, no smoothing or acceleration model)

Interaction
- Selection visualization polish
  (occlusion, scaling, depth interaction)

Tooling
- Inspector edit persistence
  (live edits not saved or undoable)
- Input system refactor
  (centralized, capture rules still evolving)

Performance
- Octree diagnostics and experimentation
  (pooling/caching not finalized)


NOT STARTED
-----------
